## Description

Rema Evakuering is a real-time evacuation management panel developed for Rema 1000 distributional RDÃ˜. It provides a live overview of evacuation status across warehouse zones and is used both on the central office monitor and by assigned staff via a Progressive Web App (PWA). The panel ensures fast, coordinated fire safety response by allowing users to update zone status instantly.
